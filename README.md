# UI-API-Project

### Weather Accordion
This is a project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program meant to test your programming knowledge in specifically utilizing APIs with javascript, DOM, and responsive design with a UI type in mind. For this project, I chose the accordion UI and implemented data from the Dark Sky Forecast API that tracks the day to day forecast in specific locations. For this one, I ended up going with New York City since it was the default location the API displayed.
